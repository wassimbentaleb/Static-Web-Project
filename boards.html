                            item, made on a custom-order basis only. Because of this, it will take 4 to 6 weeks to
                            receive your board, but it will be a one of a kind item that no one else but you has. The
                            chess board has an ebony frame with spalted maple inlays surrounding squares of maple and

                            Board a nice, dramatic contrast, and the spalted maple inlaid in its frame really ties the

                            version of this board which has a unique, darker coloration that gives it a very masculine
                            feel that is perfect for the office, man cave, or bachelor’s pad. The Purpleheart & Curly
                            Maple Chess Board Version, however, has a unique purplish red color that gives the board a
                            fun feel. In certain lighting, the color even borders on pink. This is a step away from the
                            more traditional design that introduces a bit more playfulness without sacrificing quality.
